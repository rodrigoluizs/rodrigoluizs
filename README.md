# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rodrigo!

I build systems that workâ€”and keep working, no matter what. For the past 10+ years, Iâ€™ve been designing systems that can handle heavy load and do not fall apart under pressure. I enjoy solving complicated problems and keeping things simple. If the challenge is big, Iâ€™m in. Currently working as a **Staff Engineer**.

### ðŸ’» What I Do:
- Create systems that scale nicely
- Make microservices work well together
- Build APIs that handle heavy use without breaking
- Try to give back to the community as much as I can
