# 👋 Hey there! I’m Rodrigo

A **Staff Engineer** with a passion for building systems that can handle anything you throw at them. Over the past **10+ years**, I’ve been designing high-availability, high-traffic architectures that keep things running smoothly, no matter the scale.

### 💻 What I’m All About:
- **Crafting resilient cloud architectures**
- **Making microservices play nice together**
- **Building APIs that just *work* (and keep working under pressure)**

I love tackling big challenges and pushing boundaries to bring new ideas to life. If it’s mission-critical, high-traffic, and needs to be rock-solid, I’m in! Let’s build the future, one system at a time. 🌐
